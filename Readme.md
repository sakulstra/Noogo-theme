### About
Attemp to replace the *.croogo.org/* themes with an unified theme

### Targets
Croogo.org and other project pages should be an example of good design and high performance.
So we should avoid downscaling images, above the fold loading and stuff like that.
Actually the croogo.org page has a load of ~300kb... i think we could reduce the load to sth. like ~150kb
[] Have one theme for all sites (croogo.org)
[] Above the fold loading
[] optimize images
